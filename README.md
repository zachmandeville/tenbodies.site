# The Site
shop.angblev.com is a catch all shop for Angelica's jewelry, yoga, music, and art.

It's main components right now are:
- a section for jewelry to buy online

- a section for music where she shares mixes.

1. The site should be easy for Angelica and myself to understand
2. It should be zippy and easy to use for Angblev fans
3. There should be no limitation on its design imposed by Shopify. The products
   can be wherever, the cart travels with you through the site.
